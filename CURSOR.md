# Cursor Agent Instructions

You are a Cursor agent assigned to implement work in the GrokClaw repository.

---

## When you are assigned a ticket

1. **Read the Linear ticket** — the description contains the full spec, acceptance criteria, and implementation notes. Read it before touching any code.
2. **Read `AGENTS.md`** — understand the system you are working on.
3. **Read `memory/MEMORY.md`** — understand what's already built so you don't duplicate work.
4. **Check out the branch** — your branch is `grok/<GRO-XX>` or `cursor/<GRO-XX-slug>`. It already exists on origin.
5. **Implement the work** — write real code, config, or documentation. No placeholders.
6. **Wire it up** — see "Every feature must be triggered" below.
7. **Test it** — run the thing and verify it works. See "Testing requirements" below.
8. **Update `memory/MEMORY.md`** — before committing, append a dated bullet under "Completed work" describing exactly what you built and how it runs. Example:
   ```
   - **2026-03-14** — GRO-14: added tools/gateway-health-check.sh; detects picoclaw process death and alerts Slack. Wired to system crontab (*/5 * * * *).
   ```
9. **Commit** — clear messages referencing the issue (e.g. `feat: add health check GRO-14`).
10. **Push and mark ready** — `gh pr ready <number> --repo BenSheridanEdwards/GrokClaw`
11. **Post to Slack**:
    ```
    /Users/jarvis/.picoclaw/workspace/tools/slack-post.sh C0ALE1S0LSF "🤖 GRO-XX complete. PR: <pr-url>"
    ```

## Every feature must be triggered

Writing a script is not enough. It must be wired to something that actually runs it. A script that is never called does nothing.

### Choosing the right trigger

| What you're building | Use |
|----------------------|-----|
| Something that checks on the agent/gateway itself (health checks, watchdogs) | **System crontab** — PicoClaw's own cron can't fire if the gateway is dead |
| Scheduled agent tasks (research, suggestions, reports) | **PicoClaw cron** — `cron/jobs.json` |
| Something triggered by a user message or approval | **AGENTS.md workflow** — document the command Grok should run |
| A one-off utility | **Document it** — add usage to the tool's header comment and to `docs/` |

### System crontab (macOS/Linux)

Use when the feature must work even if the PicoClaw gateway is down.

Add the entry programmatically in your PR:

```sh
# Add to system crontab — do this in your implementation
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * /Users/jarvis/.picoclaw/workspace/tools/your-script.sh >> /tmp/your-script.log 2>&1") | crontab -
```

Verify it was added:
```sh
crontab -l | grep your-script
```

### PicoClaw cron (`cron/jobs.json`)

Use for scheduled agent tasks. Add a new job object to the `jobs` array:

```json
{
  "id": "<generate a random 16-char hex id>",
  "name": "descriptive-job-name",
  "enabled": true,
  "schedule": {
    "kind": "cron",
    "expr": "*/5 * * * *"
  },
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agent_turn",
    "message": "Your instruction to Grok here.",
    "deliver": true,
    "channel": "slack",
    "to": "C0ALE1S0LSF"
  },
  "deleteAfterRun": false
}
```

## Testing requirements

Before marking a PR ready, you must verify:

- [ ] The script runs without errors: `bash tools/your-script.sh`
- [ ] The trigger is wired: `crontab -l | grep your-script` or confirm `cron/jobs.json` has the entry
- [ ] The trigger fires correctly: manually invoke it and confirm the output
- [ ] If it posts to Slack: confirm the message appears in `grok-orchestrator`
- [ ] If it creates files: confirm the files exist with correct permissions

Include the test output in your PR description under a **Verification** section.

**Key config file locations:**
- PicoClaw config: `/Users/jarvis/.picoclaw/config.json`
- Gateway port: `18800` (from config — do not hardcode other values)
- Slack channel: `C0ALE1S0LSF` (`grok-orchestrator`)

---

## Coding standards

- Shell scripts: POSIX sh, `set -eu`, no bashisms.
- Python: stdlib only unless clearly warranted.
- No `TODO` or placeholder comments. Implement it or don't create the file.
- Every new script must be executable (`chmod +x`).
- Read `/Users/jarvis/.picoclaw/config.json` for config values — do not hardcode ports, paths, or tokens that are already there.

---

## What "done" means

- [ ] The feature works end-to-end, not just the script existing
- [ ] It is wired to a trigger (system cron, PicoClaw cron, or documented workflow step)
- [ ] The trigger has been verified to fire
- [ ] Real file changes in the PR (not just the scaffold commit)
- [ ] `memory/MEMORY.md` updated with a dated bullet describing what was built and how it runs
- [ ] Verification output included in PR description
- [ ] PR marked ready for review
- [ ] Completion posted to Slack
